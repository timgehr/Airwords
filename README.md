# *Airwords* Password Generator

Airwords is a password generator that generates extremely secure passwords by hasing the name of the website you're accessing over one password that you can remember. What's the benefit? It never saves any of your passwords. Anywhere. *Ever*. Airwords can't have a password leak because your password is only accessable from your brain. Just like other password services, you only need to remember one password to access all the unique passwords for your services.
